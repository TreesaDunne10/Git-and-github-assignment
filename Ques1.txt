Ques1. Explain what version control is and its importance in software development.

Sol1. Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to revisit specific versions later. Its crucial in software development because it enables collaboration, tracks changes, facilitates experimentation, and ensures project stability by providing a history of modifications and the ability to revert to previous states if needed.

Here is the importances of version control in software development:
1.  Collaboration : It enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously by managing changes and merging them together. This facilitates teamwork and prevents conflicts that could arise from concurrent editing.

2.  Change Tracking : Version control systems keep a detailed history of every change made to the codebase. This history includes who made the change, when it was made, and what exactly was changed. This makes it easy to track the evolution of the project and understand why certain decisions were made.

3.  Reproducibility : With version control, its possible to revert to previous versions of the codebase if a new change introduces bugs or undesirable behavior. This ensures that the project remains stable and that any issues can be quickly addressed by rolling back to a known good state.

4.  Experimentation : Developers can create branches in version control to work on new features or experiment with changes without affecting the main codebase. This allows for rapid prototyping and testing of ideas before integrating them into the main project.

5.  Code Review : Version control systems often include tools for code review, where developers can comment on each others code changes and suggest improvements. This helps maintain code quality and ensures that changes meet the projects standards.
