Ques4. Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some alternatives to Github.

Sol4.  GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories and provides tools for collaboration and version control. It allows developers to store, share, and manage their code repositories, track changes made by collaborators, and coordinate work on projects.

Github facilitates collaboration and version control in the following ways :

1.  Pull requests : Developers can propose changes to a repository and request feedback from collaborators through pull requests. This enables code review and discussion before changes are merged into the main codebase.

2.  Issue tracking : Github offers a built-in issue tracking system, allowing developers to report bugs, request features, and organize tasks. This helps teams stay organized and priorities work effectively.

3.  Wikis and documentaion : Github allows developers to create wikis and documentation pages for their projects, making it easier to share information and onboard new contributors.

4.  Code Reviews : Collaborators can review each others code changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements using Githubs code review tools.

5.  Branching and merging : Github supports branching and merging, enabling developers to work on features or fixes in isolation and merge them back into the main codebase when ready.

6.  Community features : Github fosters a vibrant community of developers by allowing users to follow projects, star repositories, and contribute to open-source projects.

Some alternatives to Github include:
1.  GitLab 
2.  Bitbucket
3.  Sourceforge
